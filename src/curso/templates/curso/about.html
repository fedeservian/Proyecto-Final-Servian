    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p style="padding: 0 20px;">Hi! I'm Federico Servian, passionate about data analysis and currently a student at Coderhouse, where I'm specializing in Python and Django. Throughout my training, I've gained skills in key tools such as Power BI, Tableau, SQL, and Excel, and I continue to develop myself through practical projects to apply this knowledge in real-world scenarios.

        One of these projects is this PCP (Production Planning and Control) platform, which I created to help companies manage their production more efficiently. By registering and logging in, you'll be able to load inventories, manage products, schedule production, and organize categoriesâ€”all designed to optimize your production processes and facilitate decision-making.
        
        My goal is to help companies make data-driven decisions, optimize processes, and add value through precise analysis. I love facing new challenges and constantly learning to improve my skills in the field of technology and data.</p>
